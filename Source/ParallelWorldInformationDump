Currency System
	-warframe has a great one
	-so does POE
Comparison between the two
	-Warframe is grindy and has a lot of variations on whats needed
	-POE, everything is needed, depending on what you want to do...
	-figure out both?



movement class very important
	dodge/roll/jump/vault/etc.
	slow  && stun should affect character rotation and movement


create damage execution classes for each type of damage; finalize the list asap
-phsical class
	-impact/blunt
		-stun status effect
	-pierce
		-armor penetration
	-slash
		-bleed DoT
-Mental/Magical
	-psychic/chaos/dark
	-poison(should this be physical?)
	-fire/explosive
	-gas/magnetic/radiation/viral
	-water/ice
	-earth/nature
	-air/lightning



build base weapon
	[x]apply status effects to target
	-calculate damage properly //ongoing
		-specific on what kind of damage is being dealt
	-gameplayCue for vfx(can we do more with it?)


	-mental/magical
		-psychic

		-chaos/dark/poison
		-true
		-fire/explosive
		-gas / magnetic	/radiation / viral

		-water/ice

/*Defense stats*/

armor			**if we give types, we can cluster these values based on level or something
	-impact
	-pierce
	-slash
	-elemental values too

Dodge/block/parry/etc	
	

/*Offensive stats */

	/*for both physical/mental attributes*/

base Damage 	equipment flat damage +  strength + (equipment stats + spell stats) ) * (equipment multipliers + spell multipliers)
crit chance		equipment flat damage +  dexterity + (equipment stats + spell stats) ) * (equipment multipliers + spell multipliers)
crit Damage 	equipment base + dexterity + strength  * multipliers
attack speed 	(weapon base + (strength + dexterity) + (equipment stats + spell stats) ) * (equipment multipliers + spell multipliers)
range			equipment / spell based
damage falloff	equipment / spell based
accuracy		random RNG based on dice? 
status chance	entirely equipment based 
armor penetration equipment based



target attack
	-hitscane
	-projectile
	-pbaoe
	-targeted aoe
	-channeled

instant/over time -- effect
	-damage
	-status effects
chance effects
	-status or % to blind etc.


damage calculation can be individualized
	should attributes be clustered

update weapon swing and how it applies the GameplayEffect to enemies





/* status effects */   
	/*TODO: currently they are always applied, add a status chance otherwise its annoying and not fun see if we can apply the gameplay tag based on a percentage chance

	[x] instant // dot/hot 

	[ ] some stat adjustment(lower strength/dex/whatever)
		-same for increases
			-slow / snare / stun /knockback are all the same, just with duration and animation played being different

			-blind(no attacks) - decrease physical dex to zero
			-silenced(no spells)-decrease mental dex to zero
			 -speed boost/decrease  //temporary and indefinite


	[ ] loss of control of character(possessed by AI)
		-MIND CONTROL
		-FEAR
		-DOMINATE
	   -stun(no actions)

	[ ] cleanse ongoing effects

	[ ] summon/banish creature/turret/trap/whatever


/*Attack Types*/
	PBAOE

	Targeted AOE 
		-hydroid tentacles
	Single trace - we can do a lot with traces
		-any weapon swing
		-typical bullet system
	Projectile Spawn
		-grenade launcher type stuff



/* Damage calculation */
	-Create a custom calculation class for the weapons-
	roll to see if we hit

		flat damage type(physical/elemental/psychic/whatever)
		get items and add modifiers
		convert damage to elemental damage if allowed
		crit strike chance
			-increase damage by crit strike multiplier
		check dodge/evade/block/ignore
			-check incoming damage conversion
		deal with armor penetration
		deal final damage		
	on miss(or critical fail)
		-take self damage?
		-downside to weapon
