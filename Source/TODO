    -cellular automata - 
    waveFunctioncollapse - mesh building maybe? idk cool algorithm anyway
    NEAT - neural networks and genetic algorithms are aweome and fun

    Grid Class - get/set accessors for 1D array but act like a 2D or 3D array
            -get neighbors around grid
            -other things ?
             idk
    L-System
        -FInish and figure out a good way to build objects with it, should be able to build geometry and also access the bitmap generation
        
TODO: 
Create Rock/Tree/Plant/whatever actor with GAS system enabled
    -grant resources
    -be destroyed and respawn

    
multiple targeting effects on a single weapon needs to work....
animation blueprint/procedural

weapons/items/abilities are actual objects, everything else is a currency


//for every ability and targeting data in the container
//create new targets from the container[i] type
//if we have new targets
//get all the hit result information
//add the hit results to the target data

    weapon ammo system or something to that effect
    pass GE_Effect UI Data to actual UI system
    Create NewGameplayModMagnitudeCalculation system for custom damage calculations
    Weapon stats and randomized values for each of them that are passed to gameplay system
    

Activated abilities for crafting stations   
    on 'interact' 
        -open crafting table UI
        -each button will grant the player the ability providing the resources are created
        -craft item
            -check for resources
            -either spawn new item or add new resources to inventory
            -two inventories is awkward....

                ValidData->CommitAbility
                    Make outgoing gameplayEffect spec
                       S pawnActor on server(the bp actor has the damage effect spec handle passed into it)

        -should interface with the GAS 
        -damage and tracking and all that
        -
    Building:
        -deferred spawning most likely
        -has to do collision checks before spawning
        -should 'grow' quickly and push people out of the way as well?
        -should be stored in rama save system

        -
    -parry
        -automatic and toggleable?
        - destroys incoming projectiles and reverts the direction
        -traces are more obnoxious
    -roll
        -dodge but with a roll, gives better(?) defenses
    -dash/dive
        -faster dodge, highest defenses, lowers defenses for a short time after 
    -sprint
        -working, just shitty
    -slide
        -crouch + keep velocity

        -    
    -walls are used to generate map bounds, very district 13 sort of thing


Camera
    -Cinematic camera for use on a character?
    

Lighting
    -atmosphere
    -clouds?
    -best setup for cinematic dyanmic lighting


Interfaces and UI blockout today:
    -create UInterfaces to update health and stats that we can call in the UI
        -finalize and implement some physical stats        
        -inventoryUpdate

    -should show player inventory Data assets initially
        -user interface kit should work?
    -should have a player character system to equip items
        -equip button for temporary use
            -equips to specific slot automatically
    -drag and drop functionaliy is the worst but necessary i think
        -On drop either equip or unequip item from player
